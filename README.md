# UK Sacred Harp Convention website

https://ukshc.org is the URL for the website. It points to ukshc.github.io through Cloudflare which we use to get https as well as some other advantages.

The website is stored/hosted here on Github.

If you want to edit most content then use [Forestry](https://app.forestry.io/login/) which is a CMS (Content Management System).

If you want to re-do the design/layout/colours etc then you'll have to do that here – probably in [/css/main.css](https://github.com/ukshc/ukshc.github.io/blob/master/css/main.css)

The site uses [Bootstrap v4.0.0-beta](https://getbootstrap.com/) as a CSS framework to help with layout and design

## Some editing instructions
Edit https://github.com/ukshc/ukshc.github.io/blob/master/_includes/header.html to edit the title of the site (name and year of the convention)

Edit https://github.com/ukshc/ukshc.github.io/blob/master/_includes/navbar.html to edit the Menu at the top of each page
