The convention venue is well served by Brighton and Hove buses <a href="http://www.buses.co.uk/">www.buses.co.uk</a></p><p>Brighton &amp; Hove is well-served by trains, buses and taxis.</p><p>Bus routes 5, 5A and 5B all stop very close to the venue. They each run roughly every 20 minutes throughout the day and evening. The services run until shortly after midnight. See buses.co.uk for more info.</p><p>Alternatively, you can walk from Hove train station to the convention venue in 16 minutes (0.8 miles). Trains from Brighton town centre, London Victoria and Gatwick Airport stop at Hove. A small suburban station, Aldrington, is a 10-minute walk away from the venue. Trains run here to &amp; from Brighton town centre.</p><p><b>Driving</b><br>There will be a limited amount pf parking directly outside the entrance to the venue for all days of the convention. We don't think we'll use up all this space. If we do though, there is also over-spill parking on site.</p><p><b>Airports</b><br>The nearest airport to Brighton is Gatwick, which at around 25-30 minutes on the train is definitely the best airport to head to. You can also consider Southampton, London Heathrow, or London Stansted - all of these are considerably less convenient to arrive in Brighton.</p><p>Feel free to get in contact if you need any help getting to the venue.&nbsp;brightonsacredharpconvention@gmail.com<br></p><p><br></p>
